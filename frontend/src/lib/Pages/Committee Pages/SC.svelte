    title="The Issue of Addressing Rebellions in Syria"
    paragraphB=""
    paragraphA="Syria has been struggling with political fragmentation for over a decade now. Inspired by the
    Arab Spring, citizens of Syria started peacefully protesting about problems that they faced in their
    country. However, Bashar Al Assadâ€™s government was quick to show that they were not willing to be
    peaceful when they started using deadly force on protesters. Almost 13 years later and with the rise of
    numerous rebel groups, the country is now more destabilized than it ever has been and an immense
    amount of people are in dire need of humanitarian assistance and most of all, peace."
