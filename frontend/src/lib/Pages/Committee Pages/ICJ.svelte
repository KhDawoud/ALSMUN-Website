      title="The Extradition of Julian Assange"
      paragraphB=" The legal case of the extradition of julian assange is
      one that is essential in deeming whether his actions, and the actions that the United states
      have responded to him with, have any legal grounds, and the debate over this case that will
      occur shortly will decide where this paramount topic, changing the realm of intelligence and
      espionage worldwide, will go in the future."
      paragraphA="The case of Julian Assange is of utmost importance to the modern world of politics, and the
      crucial role intelligence holds therein. The case is not just about the dealings of a nation with
      someone they deem to be a threat to their security, but also about what entails national
      security and where the court of justice must draw lines within the laws surrounding security.
      As far back as war has existed, espionage has always played a key role, and Julian Assangeâ€™s
      foundation of wikileaks.org has been one of the most significant events to ever occur in this
      realm. Wikileaks.org has published hundreds of legal and governmental documents from all
      sovereign bodies all over the world, revealing things ranging from videos of US soldiers
      committing war crimes in the middle east, CIA documents filled with incredibly corrupt and
      unjust plans, and more beyond what the mind can imagine. Assange is one of the most
      controversial figures of the 21st century, someone despised by governments worldwide but
      seen as a hero by thousands of others."
